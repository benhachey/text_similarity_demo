## Preliminaries

### Install Anaconda

Follow instructions at the following link to install Miniconda for Python version 3.8:

https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Anaconda is a tool for scientific computing using Python. We'll use the Miniconda version to create an isolated virtual environment with the libraries we need for analysis. This avoids altering OS Python configurations if present.


### Create virtual environment

Run the following command to create a virtual environment called `ts38`:

```conda create --name ts38 python=3.8```

Activate the `ts38` virtual environment:

```conda activate ts38```


### Install VS Code
